# Privacy Policy

## Overview

Google Search Maps Button is committed to protecting your privacy. This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.

## Data Collection

**We do NOT collect any data.**

Specifically, this extension does NOT:

- Collect your search queries
- Track your browsing history
- Store any personal information
- Send data to external servers
- Use analytics or tracking tools
- Share data with third parties

## How It Works

The extension operates entirely within your browser:

1. Reads your current Google search query from the page URL
2. Adds a Maps button to the search interface
3. All processing happens locally on your device

## Permissions

The extension requires access to Google search pages (`google.com`, `google.de`, `google.at`, `google.ch`) solely to:

- Detect when you're on a search results page
- Insert the Maps button into the page interface

## Third-Party Services

This extension does not integrate with any third-party services or APIs. When you click the Maps button, you are directed to Google Maps (a Google service) with your search query - this is the same as manually typing your query into Google Maps.
